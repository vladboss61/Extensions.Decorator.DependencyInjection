# ServiceCollection Decorator Extensions

This repository provides **extension methods for `IServiceCollection`** with built-in support for service decorators.  
It allows you to easily register services with **1, 2, or 3 levels of decoration**, without writing boilerplate code.  

The solution follows the **Decorator design pattern**, making it possible to enhance existing services with additional behavior while keeping the code modular and maintainable.
